# Learning-with-Errors-Cryptography-C
C++ Program that encodes any Ascii String using Learning with Errors Cryptography. 

[Wikipedia link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors)

Takes manual inputs for private key and generates public key, encodes msg, and decodes msg into external files.

## 1) Create a Public Key to be shared by entering private key.

## 2) Using Public Key, Encrypt a Message within Ascii alphabet.

## 3) Using Encrypted Key, Decrypt Key by solving equation with private Key and eliminating Offset Error to retreive values
